# Lexinel Hackathon Demo Script (2 Minutes)

## Intro (0:00 - 0:30)

- **Visual**: Dashboard Home.
- **Script**: "This is Lexinel—the AI-native Compliance Engine. Traditional AML systems rely on rigid, hard-coded rules that take months to update. Lexinel changes that. We turn text-based policies into live enforcement code using Gemini 3 Pro."

## N2L Synthesis (0:30 - 1:00)

- **Visual**: Upload a policy PDF (e.g., Section 314(b)) and show the "Synthesized Rules".
- **Script**: "Our Neural-to-Logic (N2L) engine extracts regulatory clauses and synthesizes them into actionable logic. You can see here how a compliance document becomes a rule-set in seconds."

## Database Sentinel (1:00 - 1:30)

- **Visual**: Sentinel Page. Click 'Launch Sentinel'.
- **Script**: "The Database Sentinel then applies these rules to real-time transaction fabrics. Here, it’s scanning thousands of records from the IBM AML dataset. When it finds a violation—like this smurfing pattern—it flags it instantly."

## Auto-SAR & Red Team (1:30 - 2:00)

- **Visual**: Evidence Dossier. Click 'Draft SAR'.
- **Script**: "Finally, Lexinel handles the fallout. We generate evidence dossiers with counterfactual advice and can automatically draft a formal Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) using Gemini to write the investigation narrative. Lexinel isn't just a tool; it's a zero-trust governance layer for the future of finance."

## Outro

- **Script**: "Built on Gemini, secured by PolicyGuard. Lexinel: Compliance at the speed of thought."
